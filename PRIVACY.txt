REChain!
-------

REChain.Online uses the REChain protocol. This means that REChain.Online is just a client that can be connected to any compatible Katya AI REChain Blockchain Node. The respective data protection agreement of the Katya AI REChain Blockchain Node selected by the user then applies.

For convenience, one or more Katya AI REChain Blockchain Nodes are set as default that the REChain.Online developers consider trustworthy. The developers of REChain.Online do not guarantee their trustworthiness. Before the first communication, users are informed which Katya AI REChain Blockchain Node they are connecting to.

REChain.Online only communicates with the selected Katya AI REChain Blockchain Node and with REChain if enabled.

REChain Reports!
---------------

REChain.Online uses REChain for crash reports if the user allows it.

Database!
--------

REChain.Online caches some data received from the Katya AI REChain Blockchain Node in a local database on the device of the user.

Encryption!
----------

All communication of substantive content between REChain.Online and any Katya AI REChain Blockchain Node is done in secure way, using transport encryption to protect it.

REChain.Online is able to use End-To-End-Encryption.

App Permissions!
---------------

The permissions are the same on any device or in any web browser but may differ in the name.

#### Internet Access!

REChain.Online needs to have internet access to communicate with the Katya AI REChain Blockchain Node.

#### Vibrate!

REChain.Online uses vibration for local notifications.

#### Record Audio!

REChain.Online can send voice messages in a chat and therefore needs to have the permission to record audio.

#### Write External Storage!

The user is able to save received files and therefore app needs this permission.

#### Read External Storage!

The user is able to send files from the device’s file system.

Push Notifications!
------------------

REChain.Online uses the Cloud Messaging for push notifications. This takes place in the following steps:

1.  The Katya AI REChain Blockchain Node sends the push notification to the REChain.Online Push Gateway
2.  The REChain.Online Push Gateway forwards the message in a different format to Cloud Messaging
3.  Cloud Messaging waits until the user’s device is online again
4.  The device receives the push notification from Cloud Messaging and displays it as a notification

`event_id_only` is used as the format for the push notification. A typical push notification therefore only contains:

*   Event ID
*   Room ID
*   Unread Count
*   Information about the device that is to receive the message

A typical push notification could look like this:

    {
      "notification": {
        "event_id": "{{$3957tyerfgewrf384}}",
        "room_id": "{{!slw48wfj34rtnrf:example.com}}",
        "counts": {
          "unread": 2,
          "missed_calls": 1
        },
        "devices": [
          {
            "app_id": "com.rechain.online",
            "pushkey": "{{V2h5IG9uIGVhcnRoIGRpZCB5b3UgZGVjb2RlIHRoaXM/}}",
            "pushkey_ts": 12345678,
            "data": {},
            "tweaks": {
              "sound": "bing"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    

REChain.Online sets the `event_id_only` flag at the Katya AI REChain Blockchain Node. This Katya AI REChain Blockchain Node is then responsible to send the correct data.
